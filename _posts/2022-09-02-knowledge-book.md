## Losing domain knowledge

Every business has this pain point in common - key employee of 10+ years just put in their two weeks notice! For the following two weeks the company scrambles to schedule meetings and training sessions with their soon departing employee. Each meeting is called "Knowledge transfer with [Name]" which costs the company many hours in meetings not developing a product. This is all to familiar and recent for me as I stepped out of my last position 7 months ago. Each time someone met with me to transfer knowledge they didn't even know what the didn't know and I didn't know what they didn't know. The process began for me to show my documentation I've taken and they started their own documentation all to repeat the same process for the next guy.


## Repeated questions

The other half of the problem in my last job is while I worked with a guy who had all the domain knowledge but not all the correct personality to share it. He griped and yelled at anyone whoever repeated the same question - understandably after the third time asking the same thing. I always wondered why he got angry, after all we had a very complex and convoluted system that he created!

## Is there a solution?

Both of the above scenarios would be great to solve - which is probably scratching my own itch again. My initial thought is if there was a chat client that forced you to ask a question before going to the source. If a similar question exists there is the answer, if not then you're allowed to speak to the domain expert. I'm not talking about questions that need to be repeatedly asked like "Hey can you review my code?" or one off questions like "How are you feeling today?" I'm talking more about common knowledge but still gets asked like "What's our WFH policy?" or "How do I install our company app?" I know these are simple questions but how often does HR answer the same questions with a link, especially when onboarding employees? Image the value it could bring when developers ask each other questions during the product building phase like "what's the approval process to deploy our app?" or "what is this feature supposed to do?"


## Data capture

I'm not quiet sure how to capture useful vs non useful questions yet or should this be a plug in to a popular chat client but maybe there can be a review button that would immediately add the conversation to a FAQ. I'm thinking something very similar to what Quora did but for companies, departments, or products that want to restrict information to a privileged group. For example, if you're in a C level position you are allowed in C level spaces and below. You can also post a question that you don't want C level positions to know. The possibilities are endless I know.


## Conclusion

Now imagine that key employee of X years leaves the company. Not only are most of the questions already answered in an easy to search database but the next two weeks of questions will be as well. How much time or money would this kind of tool save a company?
