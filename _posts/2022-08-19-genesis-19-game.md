## A childhood memory

I remember playing a video game as a kid. It was blocky and kind of pixel based like the original Mario but on a very low budget. I think the character was an angel fighting off bad things as you scroll and collect bibles for points. Idk if the game was even fun but I remember playing it cause it was somewhat bible based, which I liked. It was also one of my first motivations to become a programmer. I wanted to build a modern video game based on bible stories to teach kids.

## Back to Genises 19

The bible has many stories full of good story line and intense scenes if one could image it. One of the wilder scenes that comes to mind is when the angels came to strike Sodom and Gomorrah. After the angels confirmed the wickedness in that city they went outside of Lots house and struck the men of that city blind. They also began to destroy the city and finally reigned down fire and brimstone. Now if I were to make this into a video game it would probably not be G rated but lets imagine for a second and place ourselves in Lots shoes. His house being surrounded, he was trying to protect his guests who seemed like regular travelers through the land. Then as one of the guests waves his hand the crowed is quickly confused and commands Lots family to escape without looking back. Since these guests were angels, they were probably trained in the highest form of jujitsu. I can imagine the speed they were kicking butt, the wicked men were dead in no time. As Lot pulled his family out of the house, the angels ascended between heaven and earth and began their missile launch from one end of the city. As the city burned, Lot rushed to leave the place he called home and would not look back. After Lot made his exit from the city, the angels would launch their final blow which caused Lot's wife to turn around. Her last emotion was being overwhelmed as she turned into a pillar of salt. Scene one complete.

## Is it playable?

I'm not an avid gamer but I know there are games with story lines and the game play is fun. If I were to make this into a game idk if the main character would be the angel or Lot or what the point system would be. I'm not claiming this is exactly how Sodom and Gomorrah's demise came about but I'm sure it was fascinating. I remembered this thought because last night we were having bible study with my wife's family. My brother-in-law showed me a demo of the newly release [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US). I'm probably scratching my own itch here but would anyone else want to play something like this?
