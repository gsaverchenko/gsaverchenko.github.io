- The business model canvas:
	- Download for free from businessmodelgeneration.com.
	- Interactive version LeanMonitor.com.
	- Another version Strategyzer.com.

	- Number of potential purchasers * Percentage of capturable market share * Absolute dollar amount of each sale * Percentage margin of net profit = Total potential profit
- A good product doesn't mean it's a good business.
- Three characteristics that make a startup scalable:
	- You have to be able to start small.
	- Your marginal costs must drop over time so that each additional dollar of revenue costs less than the previous dollar.
	- Your scalability needs to be built into your business model, rather than relying on any special exogenous factors.
