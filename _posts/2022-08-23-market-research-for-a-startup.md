## The struggle

Today marks my first day of feeling productive. I've been struggling to find direction for a startup mostly cause I couldn't figure out what product to build. After listening to Pawel Brzeminski on [MicroConf's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Marj9F-xvw) I finally found my method.

## Some Stats

Towards the end of his talk he shared his stats on how he got to 7 pre-sales totaling $4,200 before developing his product. He chose one market and sent 174 emails over 10 weeks. From 174 emails he connected with 32 people and had 52 calls with them. Those 52 calls gave him 8 problems that could be solved. He chose one problem out of those 8 to solve and followed up with his contacts to get his 7 pre-sales. That's amazing!

## Finding My Market

Today I started reaching out to my target market. I had 3 markets that I was interested in and picked one to start with - general contractors. The other two where religious organizations and finance. The reason I chose general contractors is because I have a friend from church who is one. The other night we got to talking about his brother who spent 2 years developing an app for him but eventually gave up. I asked if he's willing to sell the app but he's looking for a partner instead. I'm not sure why I'm hesitating to partner, maybe it's cause the app is built in Ruby. Instead I decided to try it on my own so I went to Angie's List and the BBB website to find general contractors in my area. Wrote down their contact info and sent them each an email from a template I'm using that looks like this:

*Hi, I'm doing a study on the market and I'd love to talk about your biggest challenges or most painful problems in general contracting that you experience on a day to day basis. I know your time is valuable, I don't want you to feel like I'm trying to grab time from you. I'm very happy to pay whatever you think is fair for 30 minutes of your time.*

I'm hoping none of them actually ask me to pay them cause that market research will become more costly than google ads. We'll see how this goes for the next couple weeks. If I get zero replies that might be a sign that I need better lead generation.
